Explorer is a web-based delivery robot written in JavaScript. The task of the robot is simple. It delivers parcels between different places. It is fed with it's current location and a list of parcels. Each parcel has a current location and an address to be delivered to. The robot picks up parcels whenever it's current location is equal to the current location of the parcel, and delivers it to it's address using some pathfinding algorithms.
